# Reflection

### What is DH to me?

As I reflect on this course, I think of how much I have grown in my knowledge of digital humanities (DH). Before starting the class, I had no idea what the term meant. My definition at the beginning of the semester was after we learned a brief explanation of what DH is in class. Here is that definition below that I came up with:

Just the other week, we revisited this first class activity we did and I had to recreate my definition for DH. Here is my new definition after taking the course:

It did not change as drastically as I thought it would, but it ended up being more polished. I also understand what a DH project looks like which helps me understand my definition even better. 

### Helpful assignments/readings

A homework assignment that was beneficial to understanding DH was reading [reviews on past DH projects.](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/) I really enjoyed this because it showed me how broad and diverse projects are. Some reviews were more history based whereas others involved topics not necessarily seen in textbooks.

Along with exploring all the reviews, I was also introduced to different styles of DH projects. Some of the ones I saw on the website were interactive maps, digital archives, digital libraries, and much more!

These reviews helped me prepare for my own review of the Digital Aponte project. The reviews on the website of DH projects all had different approaches for reviews. Most started out with a brief summary of the project. I used this in my own review of Digital Aponte because I wanted people to know the history before I dove into the project. After the summary, I talked about the project’s relevance and the “so-what” of it all. I was sure to talk about any barriers and present solutions. 

Learning how to give constructive feedback in the review but still be professional was something I appreciated learning. Thank you to Dr. Stover for showing us that reviews can still be honest and provide feedback, so long as they are respectful of the author(s). 

An assignment which at first, I was very nervous about was the TEI project because I had never coded before. It was so scary and new to me, but thankfully we walked through it in class. I remember we spent a whole class period where Dr. Stover showed us how to use Oxygen. This was so helpful to me! 

I never expected coding HTML to be that simple. When I followed the tags and learned the markup language, this helped me feel confident in completing the assignment. I really appreciated Dr. Stover taking the time to teach us because ultimately this is what got me to overcome my fear of coding.

After completing the TEI project, I felt so proud of myself for learning the process of tags and coding. This was way out of my comfort zone, but the skills are ones I might use for a future career.

Not only did I end up liking the project, but it helped me understand DH in its complexity. There is so much behind the scenes work that authors do to publish their work and doing this project gave me greater appreciation for them and their research. 

### Growth as a writer

I feel that this class has taught me how to be a better writer, in ways I least expected. First, peer review was extremely helpful in my growth. My peers usually found things I overlooked, like weirdly written sentences or improper grammar. I really appreciated their feedback because it helped me be more aware for future writing assignments. 

I began to look for those awkward sentences and fix them before peer review. I also began reading my work aloud to catch any errors or spots that just didn’t flow right. 

Peer review is something that I’m grateful Dr. Stover included in our class because it helped me grow as a writer.

Second, writing for DH is a completely different type of writing from what I am used too. In this class, I had the opportunity to write a DH review, a grant proposal, and learn the art of blog writing. This also included learning how to write about the coding process using TEI.

In past classes I had only written research papers or history papers, so taking this class really pushed me into a new genre of writing. 

Lastly, I have learned that becoming a better writer must include new things and it is not just about the finished project but the **process.** 

Researching and reading project after project helped my mind grow and think of creative ways to write. Peer reviewing as a student showed me how unique everyone’s writing is and helped me think of my own writing in a different way. 

Writing for the digital humanities has shown me that writing takes time, research, money, and most importantly, a **passion** for the project.

***Digital Aponte*** expands the research on an international symposium on the life of artist and carpenter, José Antonio Aponte. This project shares the life of José Antonio Aponte and recognizes him as a free black man who lived in Havana, Cuba during the 18th century. Aponte is most well-known for his “book of paintings” and his anti-slave rebellions. *Digital Aponte* provides his trial transcript along with a list of his library collection and the láminas which contained descriptions of the images of these paintings that Aponte collected. 

*Digital Aponte* is **relevant** today because it portrays and honors the life of José Antonio Aponte. It focuses on his triumphs rather than his sufferings. Aponte described black men and women as people of heroes that should be looked up too. This project paints Aponte as a hero for many generations to come in Havana and beyond. *Digital Aponte* received support from researchers at New York University (NYU) because they expanded their research on José Aponte further with this new digital humanities project. The most note-worthy praise they gave was to the Polonsky Foundation-NYU Digital Humanities Internship Program.

Since *Digital Aponte* covers many different aspects of Aponte’s life, the site **design** is user-friendly, making everything quick to find. With easy to navigate tabs like: “home,” “book of paintings,” or “image gallery,” the site makes it simple to find specific information.

Another visually appealing tactic used is the font of the headers. A beautiful, bold cursive that looks rustic but sophisticated sets the time period up because it looks old fashioned.

The majority of the tabs are pretty lengthy with words but there are some **creative** and **interactive** features as well. When “Aponte’s Library” is clicked, it shows the spines of many different books that he owned.

When the spine of a book is clicked, readers can learn all about it. 

The site did an excellent job on **organizaton** by having the tabs along the top of the screen, making transitions smooth and easy to read. *Digital Aponte* is very honest about the image gallery and accuracy of them. Since Aponte’s “book of paintings” was destroyed, these images provide a visual of what Aponte’s environment may have looked like. This shows the credibility of the site, that even with intense research, the original “Book of Paintings” will never be known today. 

Some findings that presented challenges were mostly due to a lack of translation. The Láminas from the “book of paintings” are completely in Spanish. This presents a huge **barrier** to readers who do not understand Spanish. A **solution** to this language barrier would be to have a simple button on the top of the page saying, “Translate to English.” *Digital Aponte* uses a similar method for the “Visionary Aponte Exhibit” tab where they present an option to either choose “In English” or “En Español.” Using this same feature could solve the problem that Láminas presents because it is only in Spanish.

Similarly, Aponte’s trial transcript is also in Spanish. This is original documentation from his trial, but the site could make this more accessible to English readers by providing a copy of the trial in English as well. 
 
In Aponte’s Havana, there is a visual map that illustrates different locations that Aponte uses in his “book of paintings.” One of the self-critiques DA mentions in their “site news” tab is that they will be updating the map with more descriptions of each location. Along with this, it would be visually helpful to have a drawing or better representation of what each location looked like and if it is still in Cuba today.

*Digital Aponte* explores the life of José Antonio Aponte and **honors** his life. His legacy lives on through the accomplishments he made before his death, which included his “book of paintings” and many artwork pieces that became cherished in Cuba. This site’s purpose is to honor the life of Aponte and bring attention to his **successes.** *Digital Aponte* promotes racial equality by honoring black men and women that Aponte included in his “book of paintings.” In conclusion, this site paints the picture of a black man, who was a skilled carpenter and painter who became an inspiration to many, due to his fearlessness and creative mind.

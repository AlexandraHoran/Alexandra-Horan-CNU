***Digital Aponte*** (DA) expands the research on an international symposium on the life of artist and carpenter, José Antonio Aponte. DA shares the life of José Antonio Aponte and recognizes him as a free black man who lived in Havana, Cuba during the 18th century. Aponte is most well-known for his “book of paintings” and his anti-slave rebellions. DA provides his trial transcript along with a list of his library collection and the láminas which contained descriptions of the images of these paintings that Aponte collected. 

DA is **relevant** today because it portrays and honors the life of José Antonio Aponte. It focuses on his triumphs rather than his sufferings. Aponte described black men and women as people of heroes that should be looked up too. DA paints Aponte as a hero for many generations to come in Havana and beyond.

Since DA covers many different aspects of Aponte’s life, the site **design** is user-friendly, making everything quick to find. With easy to navigate tabs like: “home,” “book of paintings,” or “image gallery,” the site makes it simple to find specific information.

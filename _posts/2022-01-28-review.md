***Digital Aponte*** (DA) expands the research on an international symposium on the life of artist and carpenter, José Antonio Aponte. DA shares the life of José Antonio Aponte and recognizes him as a free black man who lived in Havana, Cuba during the 18th century. Aponte is most well-known for his “book of paintings” and his anti-slave rebellions. DA provides his trial transcript along with a list of his library collection and the láminas which contained descriptions of the images of these paintings that Aponte collected.

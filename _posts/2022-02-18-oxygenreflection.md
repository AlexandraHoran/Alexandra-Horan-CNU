## Oxygen Reflection
 
## Navigating TEI
 
This was my first time coding using Oxygen software that has eXtensible Markup Language (XML) which also uses Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). I was given a passage from “Dracula’s Guest: And Other Weird Stories,” published in 1914 by Bram Stoker that began around page 3. I analyzed and marked up this passage so that I could easily transition my work to Oxygen. In the scene I was given, the narrator is speaking with the German man, Johann and is seeking to argue with him but finds language to be a barrier throughout their conversation.  
 
Similarly, a barrier I faced also dealt with language but rather, “markup language.” Learning tags and how to use them through Oxygen was quite challenging. Going into this assignment I was extremely nervous because the idea of coding sounds like it has many steps. I felt relieved when my professor gave us a handy sheet listing all the tags potentially used in our passage. This was extremely helpful, and I thought of it almost like a dictionary for understanding the markup language. I also learned new terms that I have never heard of before like an “Em-dash.”
 
After a brief explanation of how to use Oxygen, I then took notes on Google Docs about my passage. Anything like quotations, Em-dashes, paragraph beginnings/endings, I made note of. This helped me visually see what exactly I would be encoding, and it was super helpful when I transitioned my text into Oxygen, because then I could look back at my notes.

Opening Oxygen was very daunting because I saw tons of random letters, symbols, numbers, etc., and I had no idea what any of it meant. I pushed this worry aside and just focused on my professor explaining how to navigate Oxygen. After I began inputting my text along with the tags, I was frustrated because the red square in the right-hand corner was still red. It turns out, I had accidently deleted the “body” closing tag, which threw off all the work I had done. I was hoping this was the only mistake I made, but the square was still red. I began to double check the work I had completed and realized that the quotes I pasted around “page number 3” into Oxygen might be the problem. I deleted the quotation marks and put new ones around hoping to solve the problem. To my relief, the square turned green, and I felt triumphant!

Although I was originally intimidated by this project, I feel that I learned a lot of valuable skills I would normally shy away from. Along with an increased knowledge of tags and coding, I was surprised by how simple Oxygen was once I got a feel for it. This project made me step out of my comfort zone, but it is something I am grateful for, because I might end up using these skills for a future class, job, or career.

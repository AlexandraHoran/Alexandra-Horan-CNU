My name is **Alexandra Horan** and I use she/her pronouns! I made this blog for my Digital Humanities class, to fulfill my Writing minor. I am a Communications major at CNU and am in my junior year. I am taking this class to learn more about professional writing and how to share my thoughts and ideas to the world.

### Hi and welcome to my blog!

My name is **Alexandra Horan** and I use she/her pronouns! I made this blog for my Digital Humanities class, to fulfill my Writing minor. I am a Communications major at CNU and am in my junior year. I am taking this class to learn more about professional writing and how to share my thoughts and ideas to the world.

My hope is that I grow to love writing even more than I already do and pursue a communications job that entails writing!

A little bit more about **me**...

I am one of five siblings and I hold the honorary title of being the beloved (and sometimes forgotten about) middle child. Here is a picture of my siblings and I below:

At CNU, I am involved with fellow students/classmates on my day-to-day life. I work as a **Resident Assistant (RA)** for Potomac River Hall South. Through this job, I have made so many wonderful connections with my sophomore residents and have gotten to know them each on a personal level.

One of my favorite parts of being an RA is the fun, interactive games or hangouts I get to plan! I think of activities I would have loved to participate in as a resident, and this sparks my mind to be creative. This past fall, I organized a huge kickball tournament, and it was a huge success! I made the [flyer](http://www.instagram.com/p/CVBlk4HLT5F/) and had to advertise to both Potomac buildings about the event.


Seeing my residents have **fun** and come to the events I plan is so **rewarding!**

What inspired me to step out of my comfort zone and become an RA, was mostly due to my parents. They have been telling me for years that I would make a great RA! After being one for almost a year, I can say that sometimes it doesn't even feel like a job because of the connections I have made through my residents and co-workers.

...have raised our family of seven in the Northern part of Virginia. Sadly, we don't have any pets, due to my mom being allergic to all animals with fur.

**I know what you are thinking though.** *What about hypoallergenic animals?* 

Sadly, she is allergic to them as well.

After college, I plan to buy a German Shepherd. I have wanted one ever since I was a young girl!

My mom has taught me many skills that I am extremely grateful for. One, being my love to cook and bake things with her. Becoming familiar in the kicthen at such a young age, sparked my love of baking and more specifically...**desserts!**

For a time being when I was about ten years old, I nicknamed myself as a ["dessertarian"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Dessertarian) because I would be happy living on just desserts alone.

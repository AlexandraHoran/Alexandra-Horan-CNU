### Hi and welcome to my blog!

My name is **Alexandra Horan** and I use she/her pronouns! I made this blog for my Digital Humanities class, to fulfill my Writing minor. I am a Communications major at CNU and am in my junior year. I am taking this class to learn more about professional writing and how to share my thoughts and ideas to the world.

My hope is that I grow to love writing even more than I already do and pursue a communications job that entails writing!

A little bit more about **me**...

I am one of five siblings and I hold the honorary title of being the beloved (and sometimes forgotten about) middle child. Here is a picture of my siblings and I below:
